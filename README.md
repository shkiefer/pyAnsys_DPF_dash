## Sharing The Application 

- If there is a need to specify a custom IP which can be used to host the web app so that it can be accessed externally within the network. Specify the `--ip` flag along with the address of the server. For example:

```bash
python pyAnsys_DPF_dash.py --ip 0.0.0.0
```

- Note, that exposing an application at "0.0.0.0" makes it accessible outside of your localhost.
